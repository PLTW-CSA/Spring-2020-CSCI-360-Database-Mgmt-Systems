# 2.1 Data Models
+ Data Model:
  - A set of concepts to describe the structure of a database, the operations for manipulating these structures, and certain constraints that the database should obey.
+ Data Model Structure and Constraints:
  - Constructs are used to define the database structure
  - Constructs typically include elements (and their data types) as well as groups of elements (e.g. entity, record, table), and relationships among such groups
  - Constraints specify some restrictions on valid data; these constraints must be enforced at all times
+ Data Model Operations:
  - These operations are used for specifying database retrievals and updates by referring to the constructs of the data model.
  - Operations on the data model may include basic model operations (e.g. generic insert, delete, update) and user-defined operations (e.g. compute_student_gpa, update_inventory)



## 2.1.1 Categories of Data Models
+ Conceptual (high-level, semantic) data models:
  - Provide concepts that are close to the way many users perceive data. (Also called entity-based or object-based data models.)
    + entity (e.g. employee)
    + attribute (e.g. employee's name)
    + relationship (e.g. a work-on relationship between an employee and a project)
+ Physical (low-level, internal) data models:
  - Provide concepts that describe details of how data is stored in the computer. These are usually specified in an ad-hoc manner through DBMS design and administration manuals.
    + record formats
    + record orderings
    + access paths
+ Implementation (representational) data models:
  - Provide concepts that fall between the above two, used by many commercial DBMS implementations (e.g. relational data models used in many commercial systems).
+ Self-Describing Data Models:
  - Combine the description of data with the data values. Examples include XML, key-value stores and some NOSQL systems.

## 2.1.2 Schemas, Instances, and Database State
###  Schemas vs. Instances
+ Database Schema:
  - The description of a database.
  - Includes descriptions of the database structure, data types, and the constraints on the database.
+ Schema Diagram:
  - An illustrative display of (most aspects of) a database schema.
+ Schema Construct:
  - A component of the schema or an object within the schema, e.g., STUDENT, COURSE.
+ Database State:
  - The actual data stored in a database at a particular moment in time. This includes the collection of all the data in the database.
  - Also called database instance (or occurrence or snapshot).
    + The term instance  is also applied to individual database components, e.g. record instance, table instance, entity instance
### Database Schema vs. Database State
+ Database State: 
  - Refers to the content of a database at a moment in time.
+ Initial Database State:
  - Refers to the database state when it is initially loaded into the system.
+ Valid State:
  - A state that satisfies the structure and constraints of the database.
+ Distinction
  - The database schema changes very infrequently. 
  - The database state changes every time the database is updated. 
+ Meta-data
  - The description of the schema constructs and constraints.

+ Schema is also called intension.
+ State is also called extension.

# 2.2 Three-Schema Architecture and Data Independence

## 2.2.1 Three-Schema Architecture  
+ Proposed to support DBMS characteristics of:
  - self-decribing
  - Program-data independence.
  - Support of multiple views of the data.
+ Not explicitly used in commercial DBMS products, but has been useful in explaining database system organization
+ Defines DBMS schemas at three levels:
  - Internal schema at the internal level to describe physical storage structures and access paths (e.g indexes). 
    + Typically uses a physical data model.
  - Conceptual schema at the conceptual level to describe the structure and constraints for the whole database for a community of users. 
    + Uses a conceptual or an implementation data model.
+ External schemas at the external level to describe the various user views. 
  - Usually uses the same data model as the conceptual schema.

+ Mappings among schema levels are needed to transform requests and data. 
  - Programs refer to an external schema, and are mapped by the DBMS to the internal schema for execution.
  - Data extracted from the internal DBMS level is reformatted to match the userâ€™s external view (e.g. formatting the results of an SQL query for display in a Web page)
  
## 2.2.2 Data Independence
+ **Logical Data Independence**: 
  - The capacity to change the conceptual schema without having to change the external schemas and their associated application programs.
+ **Physical Data Independence**:
  - The capacity to change the internal schema without having to change the conceptual schema.
  - For example, the internal schema may be changed when certain file structures are reorganized or new indexes are created to improve database performance
+ When a schema at a lower level is changed, only the **mappings** between this schema and higher-level schemas need to be changed in a DBMS that fully supports data independence.
+ The higher-level schemas themselves are **unchanged**.
  - Hence, the application programs need not be changed since they refer to the external schemas.
